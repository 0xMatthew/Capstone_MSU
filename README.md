# Capstone_MSU
This is my Capstone from May 2022 at MSU.

This project is an aesthetically pleasant website with resizable, mobile-friendly pages that interacts with Ethereum Rinkeby test net to pull data from the blockchain for dynamic display on the website.

Front-end made using JavaScript/React.js, Tailwind CSS, and HTML. Sanity.io is used for database queries and to use Sanity's schemas. Thirdweb is used for boilerplate Solidity code to display appropriate NFT information (NFT collection, NFT ID, image pointer to URL of decentralized hosting platform, etc.).

Yarn is used to build the project.

This is how I taught myself how to use React.js.

I was pretty satisfied with the end result!
