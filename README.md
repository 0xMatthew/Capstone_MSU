This project is an aesthetically pleasant website with resizable, mobile-friendly pages that interacts with Ethereum Rinkeby test net to pull data from the blockchain for dynamic display on the website.

Front-end made using JavaScript/React.js, Tailwind CSS, and HTML. Sanity.io is used for database queries and to use Sanity's schemas. Thirdweb is used for boilerplate Solidity code to display appropriate NFT information (NFT collection, NFT ID, image pointer to URL of decentralized hosting platform, etc.).

Yarn is used to build the project.

This is how I taught myself how to use React.js.

I was pretty satisfied with the end result!

### NOTE: cannot build project without excluded ./next, ./node_modules, and ./studio directories.
### ALSO NOTE: certain elements no longer exist, so there might be some viewing anomalies that were not present at the time the project was created (such as images used from websites that might no longer exist)
